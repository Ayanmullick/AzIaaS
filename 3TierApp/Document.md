Resume once the 'Deploy Virtual machines' step in the 'AzPSImageInfraDeploymentWithApproval' workflow populates the resource group name in the end correctly.

 
Potential Tables: vNet details, NSG rules, VM details, storage account restrictions

RG name, KV, Sa, secret, admin name, 

Put your tabularizable configuration in a markdown table. And the other configurations in a hash table.
You get a single source of truth for configuration and documentation.
And adding to configuration doesn't require you to add to the code
