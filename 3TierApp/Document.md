One could get more detailed in their implementation of the code. 
Potential Tables: vNet details, NSG rules, VM details, storage account restrictions
Potential environment variables: RG name, KV, Sa, secret, admin name, 

One could put all tabularizable configuration in a markdown table and the other configurations in a hash table.
This gives you a single source of truth for configuration and documentation unlike other declarative methods that could result in a doc-config mismatch.
And adding to configuration doesn't require you to add to the code. One could also parameterize the table paths once the table data has been validated. 
The tables could be generated with proper Excel formulas.
